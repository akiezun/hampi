Hampi is a solver for string constraints. Hampi is designed for constraints generated by program analysis tools, automated bug finders, intelligent fuzzers.

Hampi constraints express membership in regular languages and bounded context-free languages. Hampi constraints may contain context-free-language definitions, regular-language definitions and operations, and the membership predicate. Given a set of constraints, Hampi outputs a string that satisfies all the constraints, or reports that the constraints are unsatisfiable.

The Hampi paper won **ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award** at ISSTA'09 (International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis, Chicago, USA).<br>
